        <h1>Seattle's Growing Tech Sector</h1>
        <p>Seattle is home to four big tech companies, FAMG, i.e., Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Google. In 2017, Facebook's stock went up 51.00%, Amazon 55.17%, Microsoft 36.70%, and Google 33.11%. Amazonâ€™s rapid expansion has attracted other big tech companies to Seattle, such as Apple, Airbnb, Indeed and Dropbox. Since 2014, more than 100 out-of-town tech companies have opened their engineering offices in the Seattle metropolitan area.</p> 
                    
        <p>Seattle has become second best tech city in the country, behind only San Francisco. Seattle has seen over a 10% increase in tech-job openings since 2016. This increase surpasses any other major tech cities in the country (see the figure above). Currently, there are about 140,000 tech jobs in Seattle.
        The new engineering offices are growing to become major players in the Seattle tech community, changing and diversifying the community, and adding competition for tech talent.</p>
