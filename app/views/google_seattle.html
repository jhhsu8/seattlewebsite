        <h1>Google, Seattle</h1>
        <p>Google (GOOG) is a search engine, cloud-computing and hardware company founded in 1998. Some of its products are Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Chrome, the Google Pixel smartphone, and Google Home. Google opened its first Seattle office in the Fremont neighborhood in 2006. In 2017, Goggle started constructing its new campus in South Lake Union, which is just north of Downtown Seattle. The space spans two blocks and is 60 percent larger than Google's new campus in Kirkland, Washington. The South Lake Union buildings will be six-stories tall and have a total of 607,000 square feet of office space. The campus construction is expected to be complete in early 2019. Google will move its Seattle office from Fremont to South Lake Union.</p>

        <p>The new South Lake Union campus will be working on Google Cloud, enabling Seattle to become the center of the cloud universe. The campus is close to the Amazon headquarters. Being next to Amazon will give Google a good opportunity to attract engineers and catch up in the competitive cloud market.</p>
